# ==> Pouring llvm-10.0.1_1.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
# ==> Caveats
# To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
#  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
#
# llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
# parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
#
# If you need to have llvm first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
# For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
# 
# ==> Summary
